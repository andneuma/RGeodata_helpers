# RGeodata_helpers

This is a collection of little helper functions when working with geographical data. They are a mere byproduct of my work here at HU Berlin, hence things are quite hacky, experimental and probably VERY buggy.

In case you've been pointed to this repository by someone: feel free to contribute!
